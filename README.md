# Design and Implementation of 32-bit MIPS CPU

In this project, we designed a single cycle MIPS processor from the ground up for a custom ISA and 
implemented the processor design using hardware description language (VHDL) in Xilinx Vivado.
We performed Synthesis and hardware emulation of the processor on Nexys 4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA.
We also did simulation-based verification using test benches, VHDL text-IO.

Tools: Xilinx Vivado, Altera Quartus, Modelsim
